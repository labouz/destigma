    "**Instructions:**\\\n",
    "You are an expert sociologist on stigma among people who use drugs. You have been asked to label posts from various Reddit communities on the disclosure of a stigma utterance.\\\n",
    "1. Provide one label for each post: S-D, S-ND, NS-D, NS-ND. If you are unsure, provide your best guess. \\\n",
    "2. If the post is labeled S-D or S-ND, extract the exact utterance of stigma and provide a brief description of the stigma.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definitions:**\\\n",
    "The inclusion of stigma can be explicit or implicit and can be directed at an individual or a group using stigmatizing language or stereotypes.\\\n",
    "Stigma usually includes four intrinsic features: marks, labels, etiology, and peril. Marks are nonverbal cues that identify members of a stigmatized group. Labels arouse and reflect social cognitions, such as considering stigmatized people to be a distinct group, highlighting intergroup differences, encouraging categorization, and promoting stereotypes. Etiology content describes stigmatized peopleâ€™s voluntary decisions to violate their social responsibilities and engage in taboo activities. Peril content links stigmatized people to physical, neurological, and social threats, such as pain, death, aggression, and taboo behavior\\\n",
    "The post author can describe an instance where they felt stigmatized by another person or a system or describe feelings of shame or guilt because of their drug use.\\\n",
    "If the post author describes a situation where they feel unsure or worried because of how they will be perceived by others, anticipating being discrimminated against because of their membership in the group, this can also be considered a post about stigma.\\\n",
    "You can label a post in one of four ways: \\\n",
    "1. S-D: The post contains an utterance of stigma. Either language that is stigmatizing or a description of an experience related to stigma *AND* the stigma is related to drug use.\\\n",
    "2. S-ND: The post contains an utterance of stigma. Either language that is stigmatizing or a description of an experience related to stigma *AND* the stigma is *NOT* related to drug use.\\\n",
    "3. NS-D: The post does *NOT* contain any utterance of stigma *AND* the post *IS* related to drug use.\\\n",
    "4. NS-ND: The post does *NOT* contain any utterance of stigma *AND* the post is *NOT* related to drug use.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "**Considerations:**\\\n",
    "1. Sometimes people use coded language to refer to their drug use (e.g. 'stoner' to refer to being high on cannabis, 'ents' for a person who enjoys cannabis, or '[5]' to refer to the degree of the user's high out of 10) \\\n",
    "2. Focus on Intent: Stigmatizing language aims to degrade, shame, or perpetuate negative stereotypes about people who use drugs. \\\n",
    "3. Context Matters: Consider the overall tone and purpose of the post. Is it intended to inform, share an experience, or genuinely promote negativity towards people who use drugs?\\\n",
