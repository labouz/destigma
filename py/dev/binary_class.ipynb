    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you believe the post contains stigmatizing language or a stigmatizing experience, label it as \"stigma\".\n",
    "* If you believe the post does not contain these elements, label it as \"no stigma\".\n",
    "* Provide your answer as a single word: \"stigma\" or \"no stigma\". \n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Focus on Intent:** Stigmatizing language aims to degrade, shame, or perpetuate negative stereotypes about people who use drugs. \n",
    "* **Humor vs. Stigma:** Jokes or memes, even if they mention drugs, do not automatically qualify as stigma. Look for language that goes beyond humor and targets individuals or groups with harmful labels or assumptions.\n",
    "* **Context Matters:** Consider the overall tone and purpose of the post. Is it intended to inform, share an experience, or genuinely promote negativity towards people who use drugs?\n",

    "You are an expert sociologist. Read the input text carefully and complete the task.\n",
    "Objective: Classify each post from specified drug-related subreddits as either 'stigma' or 'no stigma'. A post is labeled 'stigma' if it contains any form of stigmatizing language or narratives that depict stigmatizing experiences, directly or indirectly, towards individuals who use drugs. A 'no stigma' post lacks any utterances of stigma around drug use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stigma Attributes (Based on Link and Phelan, 2001):\n",
    "1. Labeling: The use of derogatory or pejorative terms to describe individuals who use drugs (e.g., \"junkie\", \"addict\").\n",
    "2. Stereotyping: Assigning generalized negative traits to drug users, such as being dangerous or irresponsible.\n",
    "3. Separation: Promoting an 'us versus them' mentality, segregating drug users from the rest of society.\n",
    "4. Status Loss: Depicting drug users as lesser or degraded members of society.\n",
    "5. Discrimination: Describing or endorsing unfair treatment of drug users in various societal aspects such as employment, healthcare, or legal matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextual Awareness: Ensure that the classification remains sensitive to context, particularly in cases where humor is used. Posts meant as humor should be analyzed carefully to discern whether they perpetuate stigma subtly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples for Training:\n",
    "- Stigmatizing Example: \"Drug addicts are a scourge on our community. They need to be locked up.\"\n",
    "- Stigmatizing Experience: \"Lately, the pharmacy has been extremely disrespectful to me due to the medications I take. I felt very discriminated against.\"\n",
    "- Non-Stigmatizing Example: \"Txt him needing an 1/8th says he's got u 2day over 48hrs l8r only rcv'd 'Yeah' in reply - Scumbag Steve | Meme Generator.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification Rationale: This binary classification aims to initially identify posts containing stigmatizing content. Identified posts will undergo further analysis to explore and understand the nature and context of stigma, aiding in developing more nuanced treatment and intervention strategies.\n",
